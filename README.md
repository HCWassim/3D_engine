# 3D Engine in C

Welcome to our 3D engine repository! This project is a lightweight and high-performance 3D engine written in the C language. It is designed to be modular and extensible, offering features for real-time 3D rendering, scene management, 3D models, and visual effects.

## Prerequisites
To run this engine, you'll need to have [Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)](https://www.libsdl.org/) installed on your system. Please ensure you have the latest version of SDL installed before proceeding.

## Getting Started
To get started with this 3D engine:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
